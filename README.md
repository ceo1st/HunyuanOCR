## 📖 Introduction

**HunyuanOCR-1.5** is a lightweight, end-to-end OCR-specialized vision-language model. It targets a broad range of text-centric visual tasks and unifies **document parsing, text spotting, information extraction, text-image translation** within a single end-to-end VLM.

Building upon the validated lightweight architecture of HunyuanOCR-1.0, HunyuanOCR-1.5 does **not** redesign the model backbone. Instead, it performs a systematic upgrade around two goals — **making the model faster and better**:

- ⚡ **Faster — DFlash inference acceleration.**
  End-to-end OCR is often accompanied by long autoregressive decoding, which becomes the major
  bottleneck for dense documents, tables, formulas, and other long structured outputs.
  HunyuanOCR-1.5 adapts a speculative-decoding framework based on **DFlash**: a lightweight
  block-diffusion draft model drafts multiple candidate tokens in parallel, which are then verified
  by the target model in a single pass. This significantly reduces the decoding latency of long
  structured outputs while **preserving the output distribution** of the target model.

- 💻 **PC-side deployment via llama.cpp.**
  Beyond server-grade vLLM, HunyuanOCR-1.5 also supports **CPU / consumer-GPU / laptop** deployment
  through [`llama.cpp`](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp) with a GGUF-converted checkpoint and
  an OpenAI-compatible `llama-server`. A DFlash-adapted `llama.cpp` fork is provided as well, so the
  same speculative-decoding acceleration is available on PC. See
  [`docs/llama_cpp.md`](docs/llama_cpp.md).

- 🧠 **Better — Agentic Data Flow + upgraded training recipe.**
  On the data side, we propose **Agentic Data Flow**, an agent-driven data-construction system that
  translates model weaknesses into executable data requirements. Agents deeply participate in
  material search, tool-based verification, sample cleaning, and data-pipeline development, and
  iterate in a closed loop with algorithm engineers. In HunyuanOCR-1.5, this system is used for
  targeted long-tail capabilities such as **low-resource OCR, ancient-script OCR, and multi-image
  text-centric QA**.
  On the training side, we systematically upgrade the recipe: pretraining Stage-3 is re-planned to
  incorporate the newly produced capability data, multi-image data, and historical OCR data, with
  maximum image resolution extended to **4K** and context window extended to **128K**; post-training
  refines the SFT data and further explores RL across different OCR tasks to amplify the gains from
  reinforcement learning.

Together, HunyuanOCR-1.5 achieves **both faster inference and broader OCR capability coverage**
while retaining the deployment advantages of a lightweight end-to-end model. This repository
open-sources the SFT / DFlash training pipeline and the transformers / vLLM inference stack, so
that the community can reproduce, fine-tune, and extend OCR-specialized VLMs.

## ⚙️ Environment

### Training

- Python 3.10+ (3.12 tested)
- PyTorch 2.1+ (CUDA 12.1+; a cu130 build has been tested end-to-end)
- transformers 4.57+
- DeepSpeed 0.14+

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
# flash-attn requires a manual build:
pip install flash-attn --no-build-isolation
```

### Inference

Inference now uses a **single unified environment** (built on `uv`, requires
CUDA 13) that runs all three configurations from the same install: **vLLM AR,
DFlash speculative decoding, and native transformers**. Accuracy alignment
across the three has been verified.

```bash
pip install uv
uv venv --python 3.12 && source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install "vllm>=0.25.1"
uv pip install --no-build-isolation --no-cache-dir "flash-attn==2.8.3"
```

The inference code lives under [`inference/`](inference)
(`inference/vLLM`, `inference/DFlash`, `inference/transformers`). See
[`docs/inference/inference.md`](docs/inference/inference.md) for the full setup
and usage. If you lack CUDA 13 or only need one configuration, that document
also points to the lighter per-configuration recipes.

---

## 🚀 Training

All training scripts live under `scripts/` and share `scripts/env_common.sh` for distributed env variables. Multi-node training is supported via the standard
`NNODES` / `NODE_RANK` / `MASTER_ADDR` / `MASTER_PORT` env vars.

### 1. Prepare packed training data

We tokenize each raw OCR JSONL, then pack multiple samples up to `packed_max_length=20480`
tokens into single sequences to maximize GPU utilization.

**Step 1** — fill in `configs/data_list.txt` with one absolute path per line, each pointing to a
raw OCR JSONL file. The JSONL schema is documented in [`docs/data_format.md`](docs/data_format.md).

**Step 2** — run the multi-process count-and-pack pipeline:

```bash
MODEL_PATH=/path/to/HunyuanOCR/base/model \
INPUT_LIST=./configs/data_list.txt \
PACK_LEN=20480 \
NUM_PROCESSES=32 \
THREADS_PER_PROCESS=8 \
bash scripts/pack_data.sh
```

Output: `./data/parsing_packed_20480.jsonl` — a single sequence-packed JSONL ready for training.

The pipeline is implemented in [`tools/pipeline_count_and_pack.py`](tools/pipeline_count_and_pack.py)
and [`tools/pack_from_counted.py`](tools/pack_from_counted.py).

### 2. SFT the HunyuanOCR base model

Full end-to-end SFT (vision encoder + MLP + LLM) on packed OCR sequences.
Default profile: `lr=2e-5`, `epochs=5`, per-GPU batch=1, `packed_max_length=20480`.

```bash
MODEL_PATH=/path/to/HunyuanOCR/base/model \
TRAIN_DATA=./data/parsing_packed_20480.jsonl \
NPROC_PER_NODE=8 \
bash scripts/sft_base.sh
```

Entry: [`train/train_hunyuan.py`](train/train_hunyuan.py).
Full argument list: see [`docs/training.md`](docs/training.md).

### 3. Train the DFlash draft model — from scratch

Trains a small block-diffusion draft that predicts K speculative tokens for HunyuanOCR.
Default profile: `lr=1e-4`, `epochs=2`, `num_mask_tokens=16`, `sample_block_num=8`.

```bash
MODEL_PATH=/path/to/HunyuanOCR/base/model \
TRAIN_DATA=./data/parsing_packed_20480.jsonl \
NPROC_PER_NODE=8 \
bash scripts/sft_dflash.sh
```

Entry: [`train/train_draft.py`](train/train_draft.py).

### 4. Continue-finetune from an existing DFlash checkpoint

Use this when adapting a released DFlash draft to a smaller / domain-specific dataset.
Recommended profile: `lr=2e-5`, `epochs=10`, `warmup_ratio=0.05`, `save_steps=500`.

```bash
MODEL_PATH=/path/to/HunyuanOCR/base/model \
DFLASH_INIT=/path/to/existing/dflash/checkpoint \
TRAIN_DATA=./data/parsing_packed_20480.jsonl \
NPROC_PER_NODE=8 \
bash scripts/sft_dflash_finetune.sh
```

Entry: [`train/train_draft_from_dflash.py`](train/train_draft_from_dflash.py).

## 🧪 Inference

HunyuanOCR-1.5 uses a **single unified environment** under [`inference/`](inference)
that runs three server/inference configurations — **vLLM AR**, **DFlash
speculative decoding**, and **native transformers** — plus an optional PC-side
path via llama.cpp. All configurations share the same weights and the same
task-type prompts + sampling + post-processing, so their outputs are directly
comparable, and we have verified their accuracy alignment.

- **vLLM AR** — autoregressive serving. → [`inference/vLLM`](inference/vLLM)
- **DFlash** — AR + DFlash speculative decoding (lossless acceleration for long
  outputs). → [`inference/DFlash`](inference/DFlash)
- **transformers** — native multi-GPU HuggingFace inference (alignment / accuracy
  checks). → [`inference/transformers`](inference/transformers)
- **llama.cpp** — CPU / consumer-GPU / laptop, GGUF deployment (see below).

> The unified environment requires **CUDA 13**. If you lack CUDA 13 or only need
> one configuration, see [`docs/inference/inference.md`](docs/inference/inference.md) for the lighter
> per-configuration recipes.

### Environment setup

```bash
pip install uv
uv venv --python 3.12 && source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install "vllm>=0.25.1"
uv pip install --no-build-isolation --no-cache-dir "flash-attn==2.8.3"
```

### Download the weights

```bash
pip install -U "huggingface_hub[cli]"
huggingface-cli download tencent/HunyuanOCR --local-dir ./HunyuanOCR --exclude "v1.0/*"
```

The download contains both the base model and the `dflash/` draft model.

### Quick start (vLLM AR, single GPU)

Launch the OpenAI-compatible server (served as `tencent/HunyuanOCR`, `-tp 1`,
`--max-model-len 131072`):

```bash
MODEL_PATH=./HunyuanOCR GPU=0 PORT=8000 bash inference/vLLM/serve.sh
curl -sf http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/models     # readiness check
```

Send a single image. The prompt is locked to an official task type via
`--task-type` (run `--list-tasks` to see all 12); sampling
(`temperature=0.0`, `top_p=1.0`, `top_k=-1`, `repetition_penalty=1.08`) and
tail-repetition early-stop / cleanup are built in:

```bash
python inference/vLLM/infer_vllm_client.py \
    --image /path/to/document.png --task-type doc_parse \
    --model tencent/HunyuanOCR --port 8000 --max-tokens 32768
```

Batch inference over a directory (multi-endpoint concurrency, resumable):

```bash
python inference/vLLM/batch_infer.py \
    --image-dir /path/to/images --out-dir /path/to/output \
    --ports 8000 --task-type doc_parse --max-tokens 32768 --concurrency 16
```

For **DFlash acceleration**, use [`inference/DFlash`](inference/DFlash)
(`serve_DFlash.sh`); for **native transformers**, use
[`inference/transformers`](inference/transformers). See
[`docs/inference/inference.md`](docs/inference/inference.md) for the full setup, the task-type table,
and multi-GPU instructions.

### PC-side deployment via llama.cpp

For **CPU / consumer-GPU / laptop** environments, HunyuanOCR-1.5 can also be deployed through
[`llama.cpp`](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp) after converting the checkpoint to GGUF.
Both the community `llama.cpp` (HunyuanOCR base only) and a DFlash-adapted fork
([`wendadawen/llama.cpp @ dflash-adapt-hunyuanocr-hunyuanstyle`](https://github.com/wendadawen/llama.cpp/tree/dflash-adapt-hunyuanocr-hunyuanstyle))
are supported.

Minimal build & serve (community, no DFlash):

```bash
# 1. Build
git clone https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp.git && cd llama.cpp
cmake -B build -DLLAMA_BUILD_EXAMPLES=ON     # add -DGGML_CUDA=ON for NVIDIA GPU
cmake --build ./build --config Release -j

# 2. Convert HunyuanOCR to GGUF (base + mmproj)
hf download tencent/HunyuanOCR --local-dir ./HunyuanOCR --exclude "v1.0/*"
python3 convert_hf_to_gguf.py --outfile ./HunyuanOCR/hyocr-f16.gguf        --outtype f16 ./HunyuanOCR
python3 convert_hf_to_gguf.py --outfile ./HunyuanOCR/mmproj-hyocr-f16.gguf --outtype f16 --mmproj ./HunyuanOCR

# 3. Serve (OpenAI-compatible)
build/bin/llama-server \
    --model  ./HunyuanOCR/hyocr-f16.gguf \
    --mmproj ./HunyuanOCR/mmproj-hyocr-f16.gguf \
    --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080 --alias HYVL \
    --ctx-size 10240 --n-predict 4096
```

DFlash-adapted variant, weight conversion for the draft, and a smoke-test client
([`llama_cpp/chat.py`](llama_cpp/chat.py) with 26 sample OCR images under
[`llama_cpp/test_assets/`](llama_cpp/test_assets)):
